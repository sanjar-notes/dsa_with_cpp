# 2. Post and In
Created Saturday 01 February 2020

Post has the first element as the root. **Root finder**
In has all left to the root as left subtree. **Space segregator.**

Are both needed, yes. Why?

1. Root finder helps find nodes.
2. Space segregator helps in giving them correct left and right subtrees.

1 and 2 are sufficient for making the tree.
Removing any of these, makes the construction impossible(due to muliple different having the same 1 or 2). 
Hence 1 and 2 are necessary.

Proof by contradiction.
Proved: 1 and 2 are necessary and sufficient for a unique tree, as each step of the recursion is unique for all trees, a yielding unique tree. 

// This is the best way, coz we get a node at each activation record. Which the best any algorithm can do. It has to be recursive as we need to work on more than one level.

**Caveat: No duplicate nodes should be present when using this method.**

Doubt: Can pre and post be used to make a tree.
No: We need a segregator and a root finder.
1 is satisfied but we cannot make out the segregation.


## Code (simpler explanation)
https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal
Approach is similar to pre-order and in-order [variation](1._Pre_and_In/0_index.md#Code). Just side is changed.
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */

/*
Approach.

Lets observe the given vectors.

preOrder = self left-st right-st
inOrder  = left-st self right-st

At the start, we know preOrder[0] is root, and also from pre what left and right subtrees are.
But do we?, no, we don't know length of left-st.
That we find by linear searching `self` in inOrder. i.e. we need in just for finding the length of left subtree.

Root is done. Lets see ahead.
We know that left nodes will be limited to within left-st. And same goes for right nodes for right-st.
This also means that only left-st and right-st portions will be relevant for each side, respectively.

Simply said, our search space is pretty cleanly divided, simple recursion should be enough. 
tip: We can use start, end to denote the portions, for both in and pre travs.

        int rootPositionInInorder;
