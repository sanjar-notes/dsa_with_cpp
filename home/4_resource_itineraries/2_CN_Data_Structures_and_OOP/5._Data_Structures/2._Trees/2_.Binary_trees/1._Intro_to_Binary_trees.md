# 1. Intro to Binary trees
Created Thursday 30 January 2020

- A special kind of tree, i.e each node has at most 2 children. i.e 0(leaf) 1 or 2.
- They are used in many scenarios. In interviews as well.

- How does it impact our TreeNode class?
  1.  Children.capacity() <= 2. It is finite.
  2.  Hence store them as 'left' and 'right' nodes addresses.
  3.  vector is no longer a requirement.
- To avoid confusion, we have BinaryTreeNode

  ```cpp
  {
  T data;
  BinaryTreeNode<T>* left, right;
  }
  ```

  Note:
  1 and 1
  / \
   2 2 are **different(bit by bit)** here. **They are the same even in generic trees. Order did matter there too.**

- The problem is that the skewed tree is different because the size of the child structure is fixed to 2. Hence two possibilities are present.

- We have created left and right due to restriction in the system, arbitarirness of left and right, this will be useful later.

## Duplicates - avoid explicit duplicates
Allowing duplicate keys in a binary search tree (or any other dictionary structure) is bad karma, often leading to very subtle errors. To better support repeated items, we can add a third pointer to each node, explicitly maintaining a list of all items with the given key.
