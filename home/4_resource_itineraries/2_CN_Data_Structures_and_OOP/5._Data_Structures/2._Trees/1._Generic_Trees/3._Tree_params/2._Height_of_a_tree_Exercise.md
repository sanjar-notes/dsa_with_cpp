# 2. Height of a tree Exercise
Created Monday 27 January 2020


* Concept: Height is just the maximum number of levels in the tree.
* root is null - height 0 (no levels). Just has root - height 1 (1 level).
* FYI: If we want to avoid negative numbers, we will be saying a **single node** is height **1**. As we will return 0 for NULL.
