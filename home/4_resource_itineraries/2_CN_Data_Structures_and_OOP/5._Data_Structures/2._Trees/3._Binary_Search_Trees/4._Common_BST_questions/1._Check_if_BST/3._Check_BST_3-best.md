# 3. Check BST 3-best
Created Friday 07 February 2020

Better than all this, let us do an even simpler approach:
According to the definiton, we can do the following. We can do this very easily. We restrain the left and right restrain. We can code it easily.

Top-down approach.
If a node violates the BST principle: It should be on either side of min and max, if not return false;
```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */

/*
 Definition of BST is: everything in the left subtree should be less than current value, and everything on right should be greater.
 In other words, we are providing a range for a subtree and this range should be respected.

 For root, the range is (-inf, +inf)
    for left subtree, range is (-inf, rootValue)
    for right subtree, range is (rootValue, +inf)
        Looks like we just have to copy value and change just one.
        But what about for right subtree's left subtree, that is of course max bounded (cannot be inf) but also has to be atleast > root.
        We can see that startValue was set from root for right subtree, but for its left subtree, we copy the right value.
        So, there is crossed value, as there should be.
        So we're good.

	Also here, we don't check .left or .right. We check current value against range.
 */
var isValidBST = function(root, start = -Infinity, end = +Infinity) {
    if(!root) return true;

    const currentValue = root.val;
    const isCurrentValueInRange = currentValue > start && currentValue < end;

    return isCurrentValueInRange && 
        isValidBST(root.left, start, currentValue) &&
        isValidBST(root.right, currentValue, end);
};
```

**Insights:** BST is only making the bound for min and max for the left and right subtrees.
