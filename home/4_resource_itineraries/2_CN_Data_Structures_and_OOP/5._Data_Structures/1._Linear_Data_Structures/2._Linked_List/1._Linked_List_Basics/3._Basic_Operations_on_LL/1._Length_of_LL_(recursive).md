# 6. Length of LL (recursive)
Created Thursday 16 January 2020

```cpp
// simple loop O(n) time O(1) space
int count = 0;
while(head) {
	count++;
	head = head->next;
}

return count;
```
```cpp
// equivalent but recursive, uses O(n) time O(n) space
if(head == NULL)
  return 0;
return 1 + f(head->next);
```
