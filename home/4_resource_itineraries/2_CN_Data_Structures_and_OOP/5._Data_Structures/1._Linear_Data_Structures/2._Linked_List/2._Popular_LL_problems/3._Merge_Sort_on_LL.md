# 3. Merge Sort on LL
Created Saturday 18 January 2020

Merge sort is equally optimal for an LL as a it is for an array. Reason:
- Base case of merge sort still works in O(1)
- Merge of LL's is O(m+n), just like arrays

Since all ops of merge sort retain their speed, LL merging is equally efficient when done on an array. *Powerful*.
