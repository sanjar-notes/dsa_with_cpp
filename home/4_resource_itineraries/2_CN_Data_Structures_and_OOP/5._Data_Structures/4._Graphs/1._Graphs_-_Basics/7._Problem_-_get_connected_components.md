# 7. Problem - get connected components
Created Tuesday 31 March 2020

Lets do by DFS. Initialize visited with -1. Since unconnected nodes are possible. We do a loop of visited and run dfs inside this loop. During first iteration (i.e. its DFS), store 1 in visited for all nodes. For second iteration, store 2 and similarly. Since we don't run DFS on visited nodes, all connected components of subgraph will have the same number. To get the subgraphs traverse the visited and collect the nodes.

```js
function getConnectedComponents() { // just bfs
	vis = { node1: -1, node2: -1, node3: -1 ... }; // dont enqueue again notepad

	let groupNumber = 1; // changed here, number instead of `true`
	for (let i of nodes)
	{
		if (vis[i] == -1) {
			q = [i];
			vis[i] = groupNumber; // changed here, mark group number
		}

		while(q.empty()) {
			node = q.pop();
			// if (node.value = key) break true; (let search fail, so all nodes are traversed)
			
			for (nbr of node)
			{
				if(!vis[nbr])  { 
					vis[nbr] = groupNumber;
					q.push(nbr);
				}
			}
		}

		groupNumber++; // changed here, next group
	}

	const groups = {};
	for(let (i, j) of vis) { // or Object.entries()
		if (groups[j]) groups[j] = [];
		groups[j].push(i);
	}

	return groups;
}
