# 2. Get Path
Created Tuesday 31 March 2020

Given A and B nodes.
Return the path from A to B, if it exists.

* Path may not necessarily be the shortest in our algorithm.

Two paths are possible:
1. DFS Path
2. BFS Path

1. DFS - quite simple. Once key is found, build a path in the recursion return journey. Reverse it. No extra space or time.
2. BFS - returns the shortest path. Why property of BFS (maximizes spread -> minimizes depth). Just make a diagram. BFS gives shortest path but not in the shortest time (efficiency issues). Note down previous for each node, once found, traverse from current.prev and similarly all the way to A. This means writing to all nodes (worst), but space complexity is still V + V = O(V). So fine, no extra space or time.

* We just run BFS and stop if we find the key or the graph ends. While checking for key.
* We check if visited has the key. If it does, then we print it, then check it's predecessor(in the visited graph). We do this until we reach -1. Stop.

## Conclusion
Generate path using DFS and BFS is as efficient as without path generation.
