- Breadth-first and depth-first search provide mechanisms to visit each edge and vertex of the graph. They prove the basis of most simple, efficient graph algorithms.
- BFS and DFS are optimal algorithms, since they cover all vertices and edges, and run in O(V+E) time.
- Many algorithms like topological sorting use DFS and BFS in augmented ways, i.e. you run some extra code, maybe before or after visiting a node.
