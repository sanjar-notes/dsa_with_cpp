# 1. Graph coloring

## What is graph coloring
The vertex-coloring problem seeks to assign a label (or color) to each vertex of a graph such that no edge links any two vertices of the same color.

We can easily avoid all conflicts by assigning each vertex a unique color. However, the goal is to use as few colors as possible.

2-colorable would mean a graph that can be colored in 2 colors.

Implementation: BFS or DFS any traversal can do this.
