# 6. Dijkstra's Algorithm
Created Sunday 26 April 2020

## Goal
Shortest Paths from Source to all Vertices. Paths can also traced easily.

note: doesn't work for negative edged graphs. And simple transformation doesn't help either.

## Approach
It's a greedy algorithm. 
1. We maintain two arrays `dist` (distance from source) and `explored` (boolean), and vertexCount.
2. Set `dist[source] = 0` and all others to infinite (`INT_MAX` in C++). `explored` are all false, and vertexCount = 0.
3. Pick the min dist node (say u), and explore its nbrs, i.e. for each nbr, update:
	`dist[nbr] = min(dist[nbr], dist[u] + u_to_nbr_weight`
4. Mark the min dist node as explored. vertexCount++.
5. Repeat 3 and 4 until vertexCount == V. 
6. Stop.

Note:
- Observe that the subgraph is built incrementally (only one subgraph throughout). This is exactly like Prims, except the relaxation (nbr consideration) is different.
- For disconnected nodes and graphs, their values will always be Infinity, since only a connected node could have reduced your value (and this won't happen since there's only one subgraph). So their value remains infinity. We do have to increase vertexCount though, for the algorithm to stop.

```cpp
class Solution
{
public:
    // Function to find the shortest distance of all the vertices
    // from the source vertex S.

    // handles disconnected components as well
    vector<int> dijkstra(int V, vector<vector<int>> adj[], int S)
    {
        vector<int> dist(V, INT_MAX);
        vector<vector<int>> paths(V, vector<int>()); // source to node paths for each node/alternatively can use parent notation
        vector<int> explored(V, 0);

        if (!V) // no nodes (empty graph)
            return dist;

        dist[S] = 0;

        int count = 0;
        while (count < V)
        {
            // select min dist unexplored node
            int u = -1;
            int distMax = INT_MAX;
            for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
            {
                if (!explored[i] && dist[i] < distMax)
                {
                    distMax = dist[i];
                    u = i;
                }
            }

            if (u != -1) // not an isolated node (disconnected graph)
            {
                explored[u] = 1;
                int s2u = dist[u];

                // relax neighbors
                for (auto ew : adj[u])
                {
                    int v = ew[0];
                    int u2v = ew[1];

                    if (dist[v] > s2u + u2v)
                    {
                        dist[v] = s2u + u2v; // update distance

                        // update path
                        paths[v].resize(paths[u].size()); // copy parents path
                        for (int i = 0; i < paths[u].size(); i++)
                        {
                            paths[v][i] = paths[u][i];
                        }
                        paths[v].push_back(u); // add parent
                    }
                }
            }
            count++; // isolated or not, vertex count should be increased
        }

        // print paths
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            cout << i << ":  ";
            for (int j = 0; j < paths[i].size(); j++)
            {
                cout << paths[i][j] << " ";
            }
            cout << endl;
        }

        return dist;
    }
};
```

## Optimized (priority queue)
The naive version above, finds the minimum by looping over dist (length V). We can reduce this by using a min priority queue. The PQ will save `pair<int, int> of <distance, node>`, key will be distance.

A small catch here is the PQ doesn't support random writes. This means we need both PQ and dist array. This way we can write relaxations into dist array. And we can also ignore stale elements in PQ (if their value is less in dist, we'll ignore).

## Efficiency
We consider all nodes and all edges (during nbr consideration), we also do a lookup from PQ.

- Time - (V+E) log(E)
- Space - O(V+E)

- Adjacency list is fine.
