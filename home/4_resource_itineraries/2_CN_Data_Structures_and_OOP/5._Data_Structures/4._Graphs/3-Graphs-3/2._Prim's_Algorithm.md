# 5. Prim's Algorithm
Created Saturday 25 April 2020

## Overview
* Generates an MST from a given graph.
* Greedy algorithm: We select the myopically best option.

The idea is to consider the graph as a tree-part (MST being made) and non-tree-part. We are trying to grow the tree-part until all nodes are part of it.

We iterate over the edges in low to high order, and try to attach them to the tree part (of course doing a O(1) cycle check).

## Algorithm
Containers - inTree boolean map for nodes, min priority_queue based on edge weight for edges.

1. Choose any node as the start node. Add its neighbors into a priority queue.
2. Choose the least weight edge from queue. Add its nbrs in the queue.
	- Ignore nbrs that are already in tree.
3. Repeat until queue is empty.

- Its important to add edges iteratively, and not at once. Since we explore the graph in a connected manner. If you add all at once, an edge may not be close to the tree being formed, which is not Prims.
## Code
[problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-spanning-tree/)
```cpp
int spanningTree(int V, vector<vector<int>> adj[])
{
    vector<int> intree(V, 0);
    priority_queue<T, vector<T>, greater<T>> edges;

    // products - no special code needed
    int totalWeight = 0;
    vector<int> pathTracker (V, 0); // stores parent of i

    intree[0] = 1;
    for (auto edge : adj[0])
    {
        int u = 0;
        int v = edge[0];
        int wt = edge[1];
        edges.push(make_pair(wt, make_pair(u, v)));
    }

    while (!edges.empty())
    {
        auto edge = edges.top();
        edges.pop();

        int wt = edge.first;
        int u = edge.second.first;
        int v = edge.second.second;

        if (intree[u] && intree[v]) // cycle forming edge
            continue;

        int outNode = intree[u] ? v : u;
        int inNode  = intree[u] ? u : v;

        // add edges iteratively, not all at once
        // since Prims grows only one tree
        for (auto edge : adj[v])
        {
            int w = edge[0];
            if (intree[w]) continue; // cycle forming edge

            int nbr_wt = edge[1];
            edges.push(make_pair(nbr_wt, make_pair(v, w)));
        }

        intree[outNode] = 1;

        // products
        totalWeight += wt;
        pathTracker[outNode] = inNode;
    }

    return totalWeight;
}
```

## Complexity
Time: O(E \* logV). The priority queue stores only edges that won't form a cycle, so its just the vertices.
Space: O(V+E). for intree boolean array and the priority queue.

- Adjacency list works just fine.
