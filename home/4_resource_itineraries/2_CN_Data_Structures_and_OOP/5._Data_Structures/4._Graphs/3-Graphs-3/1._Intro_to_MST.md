# 1. Intro to MST
Created Sunday 19 April 2020

## Intro
A spanning tree of a connected graph G = (V,E) is a subset of edges from E forming a tree connecting all vertices of V. For edge-weighted graphs, we are particularly interested in the minimum spanning treeâ€”the spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible.

Minimum spanning trees are the answer whenever we need to connect a set of points (representing cities, homes, junctions, or other locations) cheaply using the smallest amount of roadway, wire, or pipe. i.e., cheapest (minimum sum) connected subgraph.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
**Tree:** A connected graph with no cycles.

**Spanning Tree:** Given a simple (no loops or multi-edge) undirected connected graph, a tree containing all the vertices of the graph is called a spanning tree.

- Multiple MSTs for a given graph. At-least one does.
- An MST is a tree, so |V| - |E| = 1

**Minimum Spanning Tree:** For a weighted, connected, and undirected graph, a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a tree with the least weight. There could be multiple MSTs for the same graph.

### Remember the MST requirements for a given graph:
1. Weighted
2. Undirected
3. Connected

### Uniqueness:
If each edge has a distinct weight, then there will be only one unique minimum spanning tree.
Simple proof: For different trees, at least one edge is different.

### Invariants and Properties:
* Adding any edge to an MST creates a cycle.
* Finding MST for a given weighted, connected, and undirected graph.

### Naive Approach:
1. Find all the spanning trees.
2. Find the weight of each (i.e., sum of edges).
3. Trees with minimum values of weight are MSTs.
