# 3. Collision Handling
Created Tuesday 18 February 2020

Problem: Two keys have the same values. How to manage it?

There are two techniques:
1. Closed Hashing(also called seperate chaining) - we will have to adjust with the same element. Every bucket has its chain of LinkedLists.

2. Open addressing(aka Open chaining) - Find an alternate for the key we want to put, coz the index is already occupied. How to find an alternate place? There are many ways to do this.

Basic: h<sub>i</sub>(a) = h(a) + f(i), where f(0) = 0. in english, it means the index we should try after i attempts of inserting (and something already exists). h(a) is the first (original) index that we figured from the hash code and compression.

After this we will apply the compression function again if we go out of range.
Techniques just change the f(i)

1. Linear Probing: f(i) = i. (advance by index of current attempt - i.e. 1st, 2nd etc). Has the problem of key localization.
2. Quadratic Probing: f(i) = i<sup>2</sup>. This ensures that the keys are spread.
3. Double hashing: We will take another hash function h'(a), we do f(i) = i\*h'(a)

i.e h<sub>i</sub>(a) = h(a) + f(i) is what we use.

- Separate chaining is more popular and easy to develop. There is no design except one hash function.
