## Principal engineer
Q: As principal software engineer, what kind of work have you done in past 6 months in Oracle?
What are you upcoming goals?

A: Day starts with standup (last 24h and what today). Bugs and features.

## Quitting a job and study
This should be last resort.

## Resume is a single thing recruiter cares about
So keep resume effective:
- Use numbers
- Add transition

## Stop making identity based on stack
All software is mostly design, programming, testing. Tools don't matter that much.

## What you want exists, look for it
I have wasted a lot of peace, time thinking I'm whiny, unrealistic which made me miss even common and known info, that was helpful to my goal, almost exactly.

So prioritize:
1. Find, reinterpret, create artifacts
2. as a last resort, assume you're wrong, and accept whiny
