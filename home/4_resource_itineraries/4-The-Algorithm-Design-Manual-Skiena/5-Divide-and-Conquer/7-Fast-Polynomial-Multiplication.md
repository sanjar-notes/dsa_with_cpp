# 7. Fast Polynomial Multiplication
Created Tue Jul 30, 2024 at 12:30 AM

180-182
*The fast convolution algorithm uses divide and conquer, but a detailed proof of correctness relies on fairly sophisticated properties of complex numbers and linear algebra that are beyond the scope of what I want to do here.*

- Any polynomial can be represented as a set of points.
- Its easier to work with points, and DnC becomes applicable.
