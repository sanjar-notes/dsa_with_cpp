## Properties of logarithms
- The base of the logarithm has no real impact on the growth rate. Changing the base of the log does not affect the asymptotic complexity. Example: The effectiveness of binary search comes from its logarithmic running time, not the base of the log, so doing 1/3 splits instead of 1/2 in binary search would still have the same time complexity.
- Logarithms cut any function down to size. Example: even logarithm of a factorial becomes manageable, being O(nlogn)
