# 6. Proof by Contradiction
Created Wed May 1, 2024 at 6:40 PM

Note: the hypothesis here is a solution you want to test, or came up with and want it to work.

Steps for proof by contradiction:
1. Assume that the hypothesis is false.
2. Develop some logical consequences of this assumption.
3. Show that one of these consequences is clearly-ridiculously-false, thereby showing the assumption is incorrect, and the hypothesis is correct.
